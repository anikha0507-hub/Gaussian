# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. import numpy as module
2. craete ranges for  numbers
3. print the value using gaussian elimination
 

## Program:
```
/*
